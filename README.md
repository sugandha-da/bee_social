This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped manually.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Run This Project (Cloud Build)

Since you are developing in an environment without Node.js, follow these steps to see your app live:

### 1. Upload to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new).
2. Upload all the files in this folder to that repository.
   - If you have Git installed: `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "init"`, `git push...`
   - If not, you can manually upload files via the GitHub website (drag and drop the folder contents).

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and Sign Up/Login.
2. Click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
3. Select your GitHub repository.
4. Vercel will detect `Next.js` automatically.
5. Click **Deploy**.

Vercel will install the dependencies (`package.json`) and build the site on their servers. You will get a live URL (e.g., `beesocial.vercel.app`) to test your work.
